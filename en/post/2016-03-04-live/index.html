The genesis of that night in <strong>&ldquo;Blackman y su cueva&rdquo;</strong> <a href="http://www.nicolabernardelli.com/en/post/Cuatrix-back-in-action/#content">has already been told</a>.</p>
<p>Here you have three songs.</p>
<p>Great emotion: the instrument of <strong>Jorge &ldquo;Negro&rdquo; González</strong> was with us again, vibrating again, in the skillful hands of <strong>Pablo Motta</strong>. The nice surprise was due to <strong>Carlos Américo González</strong>, Jorge&rsquo;s brother. And thanks to him, this time we also have a video recording.</p>
<p>I see I was often playing oriented to the side of the scene: that&rsquo;s because from there I could listen to myself, the two main speakers where rather far to the sides of the scene, and fearing couplings I hadn&rsquo;t almost been given any audible level from the monitor (they had been thinking I&rsquo;d use in-ear monitoring, I was been told later). It was a little hard to play and keep in tune with the rest of the band, but I can not complain because I had arrived 20 minutes late at the sound check and had to install my stuff and check the sound rather quickly (I <em>really</em> needed a nap before leaving home, the dogs of various neighbours made it impossible, I wanted to try a little longer with no other result than arriving a little late&hellip; anyway, sometimes I get to have even less monitoring detail in places where I arrive early for the sound check).</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;El dueño de los temas&rdquo;</strong> by <strong>Marcelo Mayor</strong>, Argentinian guitarist, was part of the first half of the concert; <strong>&ldquo;Smile&rdquo;</strong> by <strong>Charles Chaplin</strong> (nice idea of Pablo) was the first song of the second part, and <strong>&ldquo;Murga de la tarde&rdquo;</strong> by <strong>Quintino Cinalli</strong>, *my favorite song of the band repertoire, was the last of that night.</p>
<p><strong>Cuatrix</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nicola B. Bernardelli</strong> trumpet and flügelhorn</li>
<li><strong>Tomás Fraga</strong> electric guitar</li>
<li><strong>Pablo Motta</strong> double bass</li>
<li><strong>Quintino Cinalli</strong> drums</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can set the player for HD, you get a better sound quality, <em>YouTube</em> streams better audio together with better video.</p>

As this is a trumpeter&rsquo;s <em>blog</em>, I&rsquo;ll share some more thoughts&hellip;</p>
<p>At the end of the concert I was furious for some mistakes I had made. Listening to the recording, I realized they were not so bad, I even like one <strong>:)</strong><br>
I mean that face on the scene was by far worse than the mistakes to which it was due, I don&rsquo;t think that even <strong>Miles Davis</strong> ever showed such an expression on the scene <strong>&lt;:D</strong></p>
<p>Jorge used to say &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter, the albums of the greatest players are full of those mistakes!&rdquo;. Oook&hellip; but when it happens, with all the concentration one is putting into it, it <em>hurts</em>. Well, I have to learn to laugh and let go, as a trumpeter friend of mine, when he missed a high note during a concert he could just laugh and say&hellip; &ldquo;almost&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of course I&rsquo;d like to be more invulnerable to the eventual lack of detail in monitoring. Singers suffer from that too generally, but that&rsquo;s no surprise, the less you can listen to yourself the more &ldquo;blindly&rdquo; you are performing.</p>
<p>With brasses, that is trumpet, flügelhorn, trombone and all that kind of &ldquo;resonators&rdquo;, part of the problem is very difficult to elude and has to do with the tuning of the instrument: if it is tuned more towards the low frequencies and I&rsquo;m wanting a frequency which I have in my head correctly tuned with the other musicians but which is at the moment against &ldquo;the roof&rdquo; of the resonance slot of the instrument, it&rsquo;s possible that the instrument resonance stabilizes into the superior harmonic. It&rsquo;s the typical mistake at the very beginning of a song or restarting to play after others&rsquo; improvisation&hellip; Sometimes there&rsquo;s no mistake and one simply thinks &ldquo;hey how cold I am now!&rdquo; but in reality it&rsquo;s <em>the instrument</em> which hasn&rsquo;t been kept warm enough, or one forgot to compensate by tuning it higher, by shortening it (colder =&gt; lower frequencies). To pass from one instrument to another can also give surprises. Of course many other variables come into play, the embouchure itself involves various &ldquo;parameters&rdquo; and &ldquo;knobs&rdquo;, &ldquo;we are flesh, that can not be reproduced exactly, and the mistake is always lurking&rdquo; used to say one of my teachers. Another made a positive value of mistakes, like spontaneously painting by splashing paint to the canvas, it can be very beautiful, but it depends on what you are playing and in which style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live&rdquo;, once the mistake is there, it&rsquo;s there, there&rsquo;s no other take <strong>:D</strong></p>
<p>Pilots say &ldquo;you learn from each single landing&rdquo;, and in this context you learn from each single gig.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Recording:</strong>  <em>Zoom H2n</em> with the built-in mics, mixed with <em>Sony FDR AXP33</em> video cam<br>
<strong>Processing:</strong> <em>Ableton Live Suite</em><br>
<strong>Image:</strong> <em>Inkscape</em>, <em>GIMP</em>, <em>Blender</em></p>
<p>I also used the sound recorded by Carlos&rsquo; video cam because being out of the scene it captured from the speakers more <em>harmon</em> muted trumpet than my recorder.</p>
<p>In <strong>&ldquo;El dueño de los temas&rdquo;</strong> there&rsquo;s only the sound recorded by the video cam: I forgot to start my recorder, and only realized after the first half of the concert <strong>:-/</strong></p>
